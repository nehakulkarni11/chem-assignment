     <h3>  What is analytical chemistry?</h3> 
     <img src="analytical.png" alt="img"  class="center">
<p>Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists. 

Analytical chemistry can be a challenging profession that makes significant contributions to many fields of science. It is one of the most popular fields  of work for ACS chemists.

<h3>What do analytical chemists do?</h3>
Analytical chemists use their knowledge of chemistry, instrumentation, computers, and statistics to solve problems in almost all areas of chemistry and for all kinds of industries. 

Typical Job Functions</h3>
An analytical chemist may conduct basic laboratory research, perform process and product development, design instruments used in analytical analysis, teach, or work in marketing and law. Typical job functions include:
<ul>
<li>qualitative and quantitative analysis</li>

<li>Sampling, defining, isolating, concentrating, and preserving samples</li>

<li>Setting error limits

<li>Validating and verifying results through calibration and standardization</li>

<li>Performing separations based on differential chemical properties</li>

<li>Creating new ways to make measurements</li>

<li>Interpreting data in proper context</li>

<li>Communicating results and conclusions to other scientists</li>
</ul>
<h3>Specialized Knowledge</h3>
Automation has decreased the demand for analytical chemists to conduct routine analysis. (Though human knowledge is irreplaceable, especially for troubleshooting.) Employers tend to recruit analytical chemists who know how to use the increasingly sophisticated instruments used in today’s laboratories. They also value experience in specific types of analysis (e.g., food, environmental, forensics).
Today's sophisticated instrumentation devices—as well as increasing regulatory requirements—have created new opportunities for analytical chemists in a variety of areas:
<ul>
<li>Quality assurance specialists ensure that laboratories follow documented and approved procedures.</li>
<li>Quality control experts ensure the quality of the products that laboratories produce.</li>
<li>Chemists with solid technical and computer skills develop and use complex analytical techniques.</li> 
<li>Government agencies need analytical chemists to verify compliance with regulatory requirements.</li> 
<li>Entrepreneurial analytical chemists may start their own businesses, specializing in particular kinds of analyses or classes of compounds.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Where is analytical chemistry used?</h3> 
Applications of analytical chemistry include:
<ul>
<li>Assuring the safety and quality of food, pharmaceuticals, and water</li>
<li>Assuring compliance with environmental and other regulations</li>
<li>Supporting the legal process</li>
<li>Helping physicians diagnose diseases</li>
<li>Providing measurements and documentation essential to trade and commerce</li>
</ul>
Analytical chemists often work in service-related jobs and are employed in industry, academia, and government.

    <h1 id="t2">Inorganic Chemistry</h1>

    <h3>Some chapters come under Inorganic Chemistry</h3>
    <p>
<p>(a) Organometallic Chemistry
Organometallic Chemistry, an interdisciplinary science in Inorganic Chemistry, has grown at a phenomenal pace during the last three to four decades. On the academic plane, efforts to elucidate the nature of bonds in the ever increasing list of exciting organometallic compounds have led to a clearer understanding of the nature and variety of chemical bonds.

Organometallic compounds are primarily used as homogeneous catalysis agents in industries. The topics covered in this book offer the readers new insights in the field of organometallic chemistry.

Organometallic chemistry is an organometallic compound study. Because many compounds without these bonds are chemically identical, an alternative may be compounds containing metallic bonds of a mostly covalent nature. Organometallic chemistry blends elements of inorganic chemistry with organic chemistry.</p>

<p>(b) Transition Elements
A transition element may be defined as one which possesses partially filled d-orbitals in its penultimate shell. This conceptual definition is useful as it enables us to recognize a transition element merely by looking at its electronic configuration. This definition excludes zinc, cadmium and mercury from the transition elements as they do not have a partially filled d-orbital. However, they are also considered as transition elements, because their properties are an extension of the properties of transition elements in inorganic chemistry. In fact, the zinc group serves as a bridge between the transition elements and the representative elements.

The most notable characteristics shared by the 24 elements concerned are that they are all metals and that most of them are hard, solid and lustrous, have high melting and boiling points and are good conductors of heat and electricity. The range in these properties is considerable; hence, the statements are comparable to the general properties of all the other elements.</p>

<p>(c) Coordination Chemistry
Coordination compounds found their applications long before the establishment of inorganic chemistry. A systematic investigation of structure and bonding in coordination chemistry began with the inquisitiveness of Tassaert which was extended by distinguished chemists like Wilhelm Blomstrand, Jorgensen and Alfred Werner until the end of the nineteenth century. In the events, Werners coordination theory became the base of modern coordination chemistry.</p>

<p>(d) P-Block Elements
    <img src="pblock.jpg" alt="img"  class="center">
The elements placed in group 13 to group 18 of the periodic table constitute the p-block. The properties of inorganic chemistry p block elements like that of other block elements are greatly influenced by their atomic size, ionization enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy and electronegativity. The absence of d-orbitals in the second period and presence of d- or f-orbitals in heavier elements has a significant effect on the properties of the elements and therefore, heavier p-block elements differ from their lighter congeners.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>Classification of Inorganic Compounds</h3>
The Inorganic compounds that are classified as:

Acids Acids are those compounds that dissolve in water and generate hydrogen ions or H+ Ions. The examples of acids include Hydrochloric acid, citric acid, sulphuric acid, vinegar, etc. One example of the acidic reaction is shown below-Hydrochloric acid + water → H+ + Cl
Bases A base is a type of substance or a compound that produces hydroxyl ions when kept in water. The bases like potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonia, sodium hydroxide produce OH- ions when dissolved in water. Potassium Hydroxide + H2O → K+ + OH–
Salts As you might be familiar with the word 'Salt'. The substances obtained as a result of the reaction between an acid and a base are called Salts. The table salt of sodium hydroxide is one of the typical examples of salts.
Oxides The compounds which consist of one oxygen atom called Oxides.

Types of Reactions and Examples of Inorganic compounds
There are about four types of chemical reactions of Inorganic chemistry namely combination, decomposition, single displacement and double displacement reactions.
<ol>
<li>Combination Reactions: As it is in the name 'Combination', here two or more substances combine to form a product which is called a Combination reaction. For example: Barium + F2 → BaF2</li>
<li> Reaction : It is a type of reaction where a single element splits up or decomposes into two products. For example: FeS → Fe + S </li>
<li> Displacement Reactions : A reaction where a single atom of one element replaces another atom of one more element. For example: Zn (s) + CuSO4 (aq) → Cu (s) + ZnSO4 (aq)</li>
<li>Double Displacement Reactions : This type of reaction is also called 'metathesis reactions'. Here two elements of two different compounds displace each other to form two new compounds. For example:CaCl2 (aq) + 2AgNO3 (aq) → Ca(NO3)2 (aq) + 2 AgCl (s)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Applications of Inorganic Chemistry</h3>

    <h3>What is Organic Chemistry?</h3>
    <img src="organic.png" alt="img"  class="center">
   <p> Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that involves the scientific study of organic compounds (compounds that contain covalently bonded carbon atoms). This branch of chemistry primarily deals with the structure and chemical composition of organic compounds, the physical and chemical properties of organic compounds, and the chemical reactions undergone by these compounds. Advancements in the field of organic chemistry have made numerous contributions to human society, such as the synthesis of several drugs, polymers, and other natural products. Synthetic organic chemistry is an important application of organic chemistry that deals with the design and construction of organic compounds for practical purposes.
    
    The term  'organic' was coined because the field of organic chemistry was initially finite to compounds that were produced by living organisms. This was attributed to some ‘vital force’ that was present in organic substances as they had something that inanimate substances lacked. The above theory was debunked when Urey Miller synthesized urea from inorganic substances but the classification is still in use.
    
    Organic chemistry is a vast science due to one key property exhibited by the element carbon, which is called carbon catenation. Carbon has the exceptional ability to form very stable bonds with other carbon atoms, giving it the ability to form stable molecules with relatively complex structures. Catenation is the ability of an element to form bonds with an atom of the same kind. Hence, the vastness of organic chemistry can be attributed to this property of carbon.</p>

    <p> importance of organic chemistry in the present age is as immense as it had been since its inception. It plays an important role in our everyday life because food, medicines, paper, clothes, soap, perfumes, etc are indispensable to us for proper living. The study of organic chemistry is important for chemists and pharmacists in synthesizing medicines for the alleviation of human suffering.</p>
    
    <p>The reactions in organic chemistry occur between organic compounds. Let us now study the different terminologies, classifications, field effects, types of reagents, the stability of intermediates, and properties in detail.</p>
    
    <h3>Introduction to Organic Chemistry</h3>
    
    
    
   <h4>Cleavage of Bonds</h4>
    The reactions in organic chemistry occur by the breaking and making of bonds. Bonds can cleave in either of two ways:
    <ol>
        <li>Homolytic Cleavage</li>
            <li>Heterolytic cleavage</li>

    </ol>
    
    <p>What is Homolytic Cleavage?</p>
    <p> If the covalent bonds between two elements break in such a way that each of the elements get their own electrons, it is called homolytic cleavage. That is, each element gets an electron. Homolytic cleavage results in the formation of free radicals.</p>
    
    
        <p>What is Heterolytic Cleavage?
            <p>If the covalent bonds between two elements break heterolytically, i.e., unequally, it results in the formation of charged species. This type of bond breaking, where the electrons are unevenly distributed is called heterolytic cleavage.</p>
    
               
                <p>Reaction Intermediates in Organic Chemistry
                    <p>Intermediates can be understood as the first product of a consecutive reaction. For example, in a chemical reaction, if A→B and B→C, then, B can be said to be the intermediate for reaction A→C. The reactions in organic chemistry occur via the formation of these intermediates.</p>
    
                        <p>What are Carbenes?
                            <p>Carbenes (H2C) are neutral and reactive species that have six electrons in the outer shell of carbon making them electron deficient. Since carbenes are species having two odd electrons, we can classify carbenes based on their spin states.</p>
    
                                <p>Singlet Carbene
                                    <p> The electrons are present in different orbitals with opposite spin. The electrons are paired in sp2 hybridized orbitals and behave as paired electrons.</p>
    
                                        <p>Spin state= (2S + 1), S for singlet carbene is zero as the electrons are antiparallel.</p>
    
                                            <p>Therefore, Spin state = (2 * 0 + 1) = 1</p>
    
                                                <p>Triplet Carbene</p>
                                                    <p>Both the electrons are present in different orbitals and they possess the same spin.</p>
    
                                                        <p>Spin state = (2S + 1), S for triplet carbene is 1 as both the electrons have the same spin.</p>
    
                                                            <p>Therefore, Spin state= (2 * 1 + 1) = 3</p>
    
    <h3>Hybridization of Singlet and Triplet Carbene</h3>
    <p>Carbene Hybridisation: They are sp2 hybridized with a bent shape. They have a bond angle of 103° and bond length of 112 pm.
    </p> 
    <p> <h4>Singlet Carbene</h4>
        Hybridization of Singlet Carbene
        
        Triplet Carbene Hybridization: They possess a sp hybrid orbital with a linear shape. They have a bond angle and bond length of 180° and 103 pm respectively.
        
       <h4> Why Triplet Carbene is more Stable than Singlet?</h4>
        Triplet carbene has lower energy than singlet carbene because in singlet carbene there are more inter-electronic repulsions as both the electrons exist in the same orbital whereas in triplet carbene the two electrons exist in different orbitals making it possess less energy.
        </p>
    <h4>What are Free Radicals?</h4>
    <p>Radicals in organic chemistry are formed by the homolytic cleavage of carbon bond. The shape of the species formed is planar and the carbon is sp3 hybridized with an odd electron being placed in the p-orbital. If the free radical is relatively stable then they may possess a planar structure.</p> 
    
    
    <H3>Carbanions and Carbocations</H3>
   <h4>What are Carbanions?</h4>
    <p></p>They are generated by heterolytically cleaving a group attached to carbon without removing the bonded electrons. This makes the carbon have a pair of electrons, thereby, imparting a negative charge on the carbon. CH3– is isoelectronic with NH3 and it is sp3 hybridized and the shape is pyramidal owing to the presence of a lone pair of electrons.
    </p> 
   
    <h4>What are Carbocations?</h4>
    <p>Carbocations have a sextet of electrons on the carbon-containing positive charge and hence termed 'cation'. It is sp2 hybridized and has an empty p-orbital. The shape is planar. It is generally formed by heterolytic cleavage of a carbon-heteroatom bond.</p>
    
    <h4>Transition State in Organic Reactions</h4>
    We saw the intermediates that could be formed in an organic reaction, now let us look into transition states and the difference between an intermediate and a transition state.
    
    The intermediates in organic chemistry are formed in a multi-step reaction but some reactions can occur in a single step without having to form an intermediate. These reactions will occur by going through a transition state. This can be clear by looking at the energy profile diagram for a reaction, R→P
    
   <h4>Intermediates in Organic Chemistry</h4> 
    
    <p>The transition state, corresponds to the highest energy in the reaction, after which it can give either the products or in the case of a reversible reaction, the reactants.</p>
    
   <p>Consider a reaction, A→D with the following steps, A→B, B→C, and C→D
    
    The energy profile for this reaction is given below,
    </p> 
    
    
    <p>We can see that B and C are the products of a reaction and hence they are termed intermediates. The highest energy of a particular reaction should be the transition state.</p>
    
    <p>Conclusion:
        From the above example we can show that the intermediates are isolable, that is, they can be isolated. On the other hand, the transition state is not isolable because we assume the reaction to take place via a transition state cannot be isolated.
        </p>
   <h4>Reagents in Organic Chemistry></h4> 
   <p>Reagents are the chemicals that we add to bring about a specific change to an organic molecule. Any general reaction in organic chemistry can be written as:</p> 
    
   <p>Substrate + Reagent → Product</p>
    
   <p> Where the substrate is an organic molecule to which we add the reagent. Based on the ability to either donate or abstract electrons, the reagents can be classified as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Electrophiles</li>
        <li>Nucleophiles</li>
    </ul>
   
    
    <h4>Electrophiles</h4>
   <p>Electrophiles are electron-deficient organic reagents. It can be generalized that all the positive charge containing species are electrophiles. For example, H+, NO2+, CH3+, Cl+ 
</p> 
    
    
   <p>Neutral molecules that are electron deficient can also act as electrophiles. Lewis acids like AlCl3 and BF3 are examples of neutral electrophiles.</p> 
    
    <h4>Nucleophiles</h4>
    <p>Nucleophiles are electron-rich organic reagents. They seek bonding centers with other nuclei and hence the name, nucleophile. It can be generalized that negative charge containing species are nucleophiles. For example, H–, CH3–, and Cl–.
    
        Neutral molecules with a lone-pair of electrons on the heteroatom can act as a nucleophile. For example, H2O, NH3, CH3OH.
        </p>
   <h3>Types of Reactions in Organic Chemistry</h3> 
   <p>Organic reactions are reactions that occur between organic compounds. The reactions in organic chemistry are broadly classified into six categories. Let us study in detail these different types of reactions and their products.</p> 
    
   <h3>Substitution Reactions</h3>
   <p> R-X + Y → R-Y +X</p> 
    
    <p>Where R-X is the substrate, Y is the reagent (which can be electrophilic or nucleophilic) and X is called the leaving group. The term substitution means one group is replacing the other group.</p>
    
    Types of Substitution Reaction:
    <ul>
        <li> Nucleophilic Substitution ( SN1, SN2, SNi)</li>
        <li>Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (SNAr)</li>
        <li> Addition Reactions</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    
   
  
    
   

    <p>Addition reactions can be further classified into:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Electrophilic Addition</li>
        <li>Nucleophilic Addition</li>
        <li>Elimination reactions</li>
    </ul>
   
    
    
    <h3>Elimination Reactions</h3>
    These reactions can be said to be the reverse of an addition reaction, wherein a simple molecule (HX, H2O) is removed from the substrate i.e. a molecule is said to be eliminated from the substrate. Elimination reaction can be classified further into E1, E2, E1CB
      <ul>  
        <li>Oxidation and reduction reactions</li>
        <li>Pericyclic reactions</li>
        <li>Molecular rearrangements</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    
    
    
   <h3>Field Effect in Organic Chemistry</h3> 
    <h4>Inductive Effect</h4>
    <p>It is an electron delocalization effect via &sigma; bonds that arises due to the difference in electronegativities. For example, in a &sigma; bonded organic compound like C-C-C-Cl, the carbon attached to the chlorine atom can be referred to as the &sigma;-carbon, and the one adjacent that carbon as the ß-carbon and so on.
    
        Now, since Chlorine is more electronegative than carbon, it withdraws the electrons that are present via the &sigma; bond toward itself, thereby making C&sigma; fractionally positive. Since it is devoid of electrons, C&sigma; now being slightly electropositive than Cß pulls the sigma bonded electrons of C&sigma;-Cß bond toward itself and in this process, it makes Cß slightly electropositive.
        
        The electron-withdrawing effect of the Chlorine atom is being transmitted through the carbon chain via the &sigma; bonds. This transmission of charges decreases rapidly with the number of intervening &sigma; bonds. We can practically ignore this effect beyond Cß.</p>
    
 
    
    The arrow is pointed toward the more electronegative atom. If a group withdraws the electron from carbon, it makes carbon slightly electropositive. Such groups are called -I groups and the effect as -I effect. For example, -Cl, -Br, -CN and -NO2 are -I groups.
    
    Groups that release electrons towards carbon are termed as +I groups and the effect is termed as +I inductive effect in organic chemistry. For example, alkyl groups like -CH3 are +I groups.
    
    
    
    Electromeric Effect
    It is the temporary delocalization of π-electrons in a compound containing multiple covalent bonds. It is important to note that it is only a temporary effect, that is, it occurs only when a reagent is added. Electromeric Effect in organic chemistry can be classified into two types:
   <ul>
        <li>Positive Electromeric Effect</li>
        <li>Negative Electromeric Effect</li>
       
    </ul>
    
    
    <h4>Positive Electromeric Effect</h4>
<p>>When the π-electrons are given to the attacking reagent. For example, the reactions alkenes and alkynes mostly occur via +E, this reaction is also called electrophilic addition.
    
    
    The proton adds at C-1 as the π-electrons were given to the attacking reagent (H+). This results in the formation of a carbocation.
</p>
    <h4>Negative Electromeric Effect</h4>
   <p> When the π-electrons are shifted to a more electronegative atom (O, N, S) joined via multiple bonds. For example, the reactions of aldehydes and ketones occur predominantly by -E effect. It is also called nucleophilic addition.
</p>
    
    
   <h4>Mesomeric Effect</h4> 
    <p>possessing sigma-bonds and pi-bonds alternatively exhibit the mesomeric effect. The effect is exhibited due to the permanent delocalization of π-bonds. This increases the number of resonating structures which makes the molecules of organic chemistry more stable. Such kind of a system where there are alternative sigma and pie bonds are called conjugated.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Positive mesomeric effect</li>
        <li> Negative mesomeric effect:</li>
    
    </ul>
    
   
   <h4> Positive Mesomeric Effect</h4>
   <p>This effect is exhibited when the direction of the delocalization of electrons is away from the position where the group is attached. Normally groups having a lone pair of electrons attached to a conjugated system push electrons into the conjugated system, that is, away from them.
    
    Groups in organic chemistry showing positive mesomeric effect (+M) effect are -OH, -OR, -NH2, -SH, -X, etc.
    </p> 
    <h4>Negative Mesomeric Effect</h4>
    This effect is exhibited when the direction of the delocalization of electrons is towards the position where the group is attached. These are generally electron-withdrawing groups of organic chemistry.
    
    <h3>Resonance Effect</h3> 
    <p>For certain molecules like carbonate ion (CO32-), one single Lewis structure would not be enough to explain all of the properties. In that case, the molecule is said to have more than one structure.
    
        Each of those structures can explain some of the properties but not all of the properties. The actual structure of the molecule is a hybrid of all the possible structures (canonical forms). This phenomenon is called resonance in organic chemistry. If resonance occurs, each bond would be both, a single bond and a double bond at the same time i.e. the bond order would lie between one and two.</p>
    
    <p>Resonating structures should fulfil the following criteria:
        <ol></p>
        <li>All atoms should have the same positions in all the structures.</li>
        <li> There should have the same number of paired and unpaired electrons.</li>
        <li> The structures should have almost the same energies.</li>

    </ol>
    
   
   
  <p>Note: Canonical forms do not have any existence in reality.</p>  
    
    <h3>Resonance Energy</h3>
    <p>The energy difference between the most stable canonical form and the resonance hybrid is known as Resonance Energy. The more the resonance energy, the more is the stability.
    </p>
    <p>Rules for finding out the most stable canonical form:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The canonical form with no charges is the most stable</li>
        <li> The canonical form with more number of covalent bonds is more stable</li>
        <li> The canonical form where unlike charges are in close proximity are more stable</li>
    </ol>
    
   
   
   
    
    Role of Steric Hindrance
    The structure and reactivity of many compounds in organic chemistry are greatly dictated by the presence of bulky groups or constituents in the molecule. This is called steric hindrance. It arises because of inter-electronic repulsions due to spatial crowding amongst bulky groups. Using steric factors, we can conclude that trans-2-butene is more stable than cis-2-butene.

    Stability of Intermediates
    Carbocations
    The stability of carbocations can be explained by the Inductive Effect.
    
    CH3++CH2(CH3) +CH(CH3)2+C(CH3)3 i.e. Methyl Primary (1°) Secondary (2°) Tertiary(3°)
    
    We know that alkyl groups of organic chemistry are +I groups, that is, they release electrons through the sigma bonds.
    
    Since the carbon is deficient of electrons, we can say that as the number of methyl group increases, the stability of the carbocation increases. Since the electropositive carbon is satiated by the electrons given by the methyl groups via +I effect.
    
    Stability of Carbocations
    
    Therefore, the stability order of carbocations in organic chemistry is of the order 3° > 2° > 1° > Methyl carbocation.
    
    Hyperconjugation
    When a C-H &sigma;-bond is in conjugation with a carbocation, this effect is observed. A carbocation has a vacant p-orbital. The bonded &sigma;-electron pair of the C-H bond is displaced toward the vacant p-atomic orbital. This increases the electron density in the empty p-AO.
    
    It is, therefore, a resonance effect where a C-H bond breaks and the &sigma;-electron pair is delocalized to the vacant p-AO of the carbonation. Since the bond between C and H is broken, it is also called ‘no bond resonance’. It is also referred to as the Baker-Nathan effect.
    
    Hyperconjugation
    
    More the number of &sigma;-hydrogens in a carbocation, that many hyperconjugated structures would be possible. More the number of structures more is the stability of the species.
    
    Stability of Carbanions
    The stability of carbanions can be explained using the inductive effect.
    
    CH3 — CH2(CH3) — CH(CH3)2 — C(CH3)3 i.e. Methyl Primary (1°) Secondary (2°) Tertiary (3°)
    
    Since alkyl groups are electron releasing by nature through induction, we can say that more the number of methyl groups attached to the carbon having a negative charge, less would be its stability.
    
    Stability of Carbanions
    
    This is because, the carbon already has a negative charge, to which the methyl groups push electrons via induction. This results in inter-electronic repulsions and destabilizes the species.
    
    Therefore the stability order for carbanions is as follows
    
   <p>3°&lt; 2°&lt; 1° &lt;Methyl carbanion</p> 
    
   <h3>Stability of Free Radicals</h3> 
       <p>The stability of free radicals in organic chemistry follows the same trend as that of carbocations.
    
    CH3-CH2(CH3)-CH(CH3)2-C(CH3)3 i.e. Methyl Primary (1°) — Secondary (2°) — Tertiary(3°)
    
    Therefore, the stability order of free radicals is of order: 3° > 2° > 1° > Methyl carbocation
    
    This can be explained with the help of Hyperconjugation that we saw, but here there would be an overlap between the σ-bond of C-H and the odd electron in the p-orbital of carbon.</p>

     <h3>What is physical chemistry?</h3>   
<p>Physical chemistry deals with the principles of physics involved in chemical interactions. It examines:</p>
<ol>
    <li>How matter behaves on a molecular and atomic level</li>
        <li>How chemical reactions occur</li>
</ol>
<p>Physical chemists are focused on understanding the physical properties of atoms and molecules, the way chemical reactions work, and what these properties reveal. Their discoveries are based on understanding chemical properties and describing their behavior using theories of physics and mathematical computations. 

Physical chemistry is a good area for chemists who have a strong curiosity about how things work at the atomic level and enjoy working with lab instrumentation and machines.</p>

<h3>What do physical chemists do?</h3>
<p>Physical chemists discover, test, and strive to understand the physical characteristics of a material (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas). Precision and attention to detail make their work somewhat similar to analytical chemistry.

They use sophisticated instrumentation and equipment such as lasers, mass spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron microscopes to:
<ul>
<li>Analyze materials</li>
    <li>Develop methods to test and characterize the properties of materials</li>
        <li>Develop theories about these properties</li>
            <li>Discover the potential use of the materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical chemists stress the importance of applying math on the job. They use mathematical analysis and statistics on huge datasets—sometimes with millions of data points—to reveal hidden information about compounds, materials, and processes. They may also conduct simulations, developing mathematical equations that predict how compounds will react over time.

Many who work in the lab say their time is divided between the bench and their desk, where they do calculations and review data. Physical chemists who go into management also spend time supervising other scientists, reviewing department needs and goals, and meeting with business managers in their companies.</p>

<h3>Where is physical chemistry used?</h3>
<p>The research performed by physical chemists is an increasingly small part of industrial research. Accordingly, fewer physical chemists are being hired by industry and government labs. Still, physical chemistry provides broad training and positions students to work in a variety of scientific careers, such as:

Emerging fields of materials science and molecular modeling. Combining the traditional mathematical rigor of physical chemistry with the practicality of these fields offers new and exciting possibilities.
Careers in analytical chemistry. Here, you'll work to understand the fundamental processes involved in analytical techniques, and look for ways to enhance and expand them. </p>

        <h3>What is a polymer?</h3>
        <p>A polymer is any of a class of natural or synthetic substances composed of very large molecules, called macromolecules, which are multiples of simpler chemical units called monomers. Polymers make up many of the materials in living organisms and are the basis of many minerals and man-made materials.
        The word polymer designates an unspecified number of monomer units. When the number of monomers is very large, the compound is sometimes called a high polymer. Polymers are not restricted to monomers of the same chemical composition or molecular weight and structure. Some natural polymers are composed of one kind of monomer. Most natural and synthetic polymers, however, are made up of two or more different types of monomers; such polymers are known as copolymers.
    </p>
    <h4>Classification of Polymers based on the Source of Availability </h4>
    <img src="Polymers.png" alt="img" class="center">
    <p>There are three types of classification under this category, namely
        <ul>
            <li> Natural Polymers</li>
            <li>Synthetic Polymers</li>
            <li>Semi-synthetic Polymers</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Natural Polymers: </h4>
    <p>They occur naturally and are found in plants and animals. For example proteins, starch, cellulose, and rubber. To add up, we also have biodegradable polymers which are called biopolymers.</p>
    <h4>Semi-synthetic Polymers: </h4>
    <p>Semi-synthetic Polymers:</p>
    <h4>Synthetic Polymers: </h4>
    <p>These are man-made polymers. Plastic is the most common and widely used synthetic polymer. It is used in industries and various dairy products. For example, nylon-6, 6, polyether's etc.</p>
    <h4>Classification of Polymers based on the Structure of the Monomer Chain </h4>
    <p>This category has the following classifications:</p>
    <h4>Linear Polymers </h4>
    <p>The structure of polymers containing long and straight chains fall into this category. PVC, i.e. poly-vinyl chloride is largely used for making pipes and electric cables is an example of a linear polymer.</p>
    <h4>Branched-chain Polymers </h4>
    <p>When linear chains of a polymer form branches, then, such polymers are categorized as branched chain polymers. For example, Low-density polythene.</p>
    <h4>Cross-linked Polymers </h4>
    <p>They are composed of bifunctional and trifunctional monomers. They have a stronger covalent bond in comparison to other linear polymers. Bakelite and melamine are examples in this category.</p>
    <h4>They are composed of bifunctional and trifunctional monomers. They have a stronger covalent bond in comparison to other linear polymers. Bakelite and melamine are examples in this category. </h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Addition Polymerization: Example, poly ethane, Teflon, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Classification Based on Monomers </h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Homomer: In this type, a single type of monomer unit is present. For example, Polyethene</li>
            <li>Heteropolymer or co-polymer: It consists of different type of monomer units. For example, nylon -6, 6</li>
    
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Classification Based on Molecular Forces</h4>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Elastomers: These are rubber-like solids weak interaction forces are present. For example, Rubber.</li>
            <li>Fibres: Strong, tough, high tensile strength and strong forces of interaction are present. For example, nylon -6, 6.</li>
            <li>Thermoplastics: These have intermediate forces of attraction. For example, polyvinyl chloride.</li>
            <li>Thermosetting polymers: These polymers greatly improve the material’s mechanical properties. It provides enhanced chemical and heat resistance. For example, phenolics, epoxies, and silicones.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Polymers</h4>
       <p>On the basis of the type of the backbone chain, polymers can be divided into: </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic Polymers: Carbon backbone.</li>
        <li>Inorganic Polymers: Backbone constituted by elements other than carbon.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Biodegradable Polymers </h4>
    <img src="bio.png" alt="img" class="center">
    <p>The polymers which are degraded and decayed by microorganisms like bacteria are known as biodegradable polymers. These types of polymers are used in surgical bandages, capsule coatings and in surgery. For example, Poly hydroxybutyrate co vel [PHBV]</p>
